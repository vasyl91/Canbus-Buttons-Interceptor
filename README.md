# Canbus Buttons Interceptor (DISCONTINUED)

This is bassically combination of [Steering Wheel Interface](https://github.com/theksmith/Steering-Wheel-Interface) and [SimpleUsbTerminal](https://github.com/theksmith/Steering-Wheel-Interface/blob/master/README.md).
Needs some improvements (transform received data to UTF-8).

I couldn'y find original ELM327 to run required commands so I decided to abandon this project. Maybe someone makes use of it.
